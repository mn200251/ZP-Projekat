### Group project made for Data Security course at The School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.

In this project we built a comprehensive secure messaging system using the principles of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). The system enables users to generate key pairs consisting of a public and private key, which are stored securely in keyrings. These keyrings allow for easy management and retrieval of keys during communication.

To further enhance security, the project incorporates mechanisms for verifying the integrity of messages, ensuring that any tampering or unauthorized alterations can be detected. This PGP-based system is designed to facilitate secure, private communication between users, adhering to modern cryptographic standards and best practices.
